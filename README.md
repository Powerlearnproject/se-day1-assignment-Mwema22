Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is a discipline concerned with engineering principles, methods, and tools used to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
-It is important in technology industry as it enables creation of reliable and innovative software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages
-Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
-The advent of structure programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements: involves gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements  
-Design: creating high-level and detailed design of software architecture and user interface
-Implementation: writing code and building softwareaccording to design specifications.
-Testing: conducting various test to ensure software meets quality standards and function.
-Deployment: refers to delivery of final product to the customers.
-Maintenance: process of modifying and updating


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall refers to sequential approach with distinct phases flowing like waterfall, used in projects that do not have complicated requirements. While agile refers to iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, used in projects which requirements are not known.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer helps in writing code and implementing software solution.
-Quality assurance engineer, ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-Project manager, oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs enhance productivity as they provide tools used to code i.e -Visual studio code while VSC track changes in files and code over time example is git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Tight deadlines, there should be effective communication to ensure everyone is on the same page.
-Changing requirements, they should adopt agile methodologies as they promote continuous feedback and iterative development .

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit: testing individual components of software 
-Integration: testing interactions between different components in the software  
-System: testing entire system as a whole.
-Acceptance: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the process of structuring a question to get best possible response from AI models.
-Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague - " list four colors of a flag" improved- " list four colors of a Kenyan flag" , the improved version is more effective cause it's precise " Kenyan flag"
